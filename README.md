# Housing Prices Analysis

## Overview
This dataset from Zillow contains a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type.

In this project, we will apply unstructured models to predict housing prices, and evaluate the performance by mean-squared errors.

Here we focus on Boston, MA. Feel free to apply the analysis to other cities as well.
